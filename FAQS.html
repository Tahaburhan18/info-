Q: In-game text chat? | A: "That was just as intended. Nobody wants to supervise an in-game text chat. We should have had to build bots to monitor the news. We would need word filters, people would have to kick or even banish - there was simply no reason for that. There are just so many trolls. Many players use our voice chat." [4] <br>
Q: e-Sports? | A: PUBG wants to have 4 major events (maybe 4 times a year) for the top players on the leaderboards, alongside with the big streamers and YouTubers to raise serious money for charities. Then, with the custom servers (later on down the road), you will have the ability to rent servers with leaderboards attached so that people can host their own leagues on their own servers.[5][6] <br>
Q: What do the numbers under the health bar mean? | A: username, the #/version of the update the game is on and your server code (to report server lag, etc on the forums). <br>
Q: Can you family share on Steam? | A: Yes and no. If someone played PUBG for the first game and created a username, that username will then be played by that username on all the family share accounts you shared PUBG to. Family share for new usernames got disabled/removed to prevent trolls and cheaters. <br>
Q: What are the characters modeled after? | A: They are modeled/designed to look like battle-hardened mercenaries to fit Erangel lore. The female is based on 'Sarah Connor (Terminator)' and for the male, there just based on gritty action movies <br>
